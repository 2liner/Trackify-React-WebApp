# Trackify

The purpose of the tracking app is to allow users to keep track of tasks and deadlines in a convenient and organized manner.

## Description

This task tracking app allows users to manage their tasks and deadlines efficiently. Users can input task name, task date, and the time left to complete the task. The tasks will be displayed based on the time left, with the task having the shortest time left displayed first. The tasks can also be colored based on the time left, where a task with less time left will be displayed with a redder color, indicating a higher urgency. The app will store the tasks data in the local storage so that the user can access their tasks even after closing the browser. The user can also remove tasks that have already been completed.

## Getting Started

Trackify is a web-based task tracking application that requires an up-to-date browser for optimal performance. Currently, the app is only compatible with desktop computers and not compatible with smartphones.
